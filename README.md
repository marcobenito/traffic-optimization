In this project, we try to proof that it is possible to reduce pollution and increase average speed of the cars in traffic jams on big roundabout streets. 

For that purpose, the NaSch model is being used for modelling the behaviour of traffic in a discrete environment. The optimization problem is solved using genetic algorithms, that will calculate the best combination of traffic lights times to increase average speed and reduce average fuel consumption.

Here I will store all the necesary code for my TFG, which means NaSch, GA and Data.
All the try versions and stduy codes will be here, not only the definitive ones.
